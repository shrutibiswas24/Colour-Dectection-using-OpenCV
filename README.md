# Colour-Dectection-using-OpenCV

In this color detection Project,I've made an application through which one can automatically get the name of the colour by clicking on it.
For this I used an existing dataset which includes 865 different colour names along with their Hex values and RGB values. 
At the end of this project, double click anywhere on the displayed image and you'll get the name of the colour you're pointing at and it's corresponding RGB values.
